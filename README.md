# Emotion-Recognition-PredictiveAnalytics-Therapy
This project leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to revolutionize therapeutic practices by creating an advanced emotion recognition database. By integrating AI tools for real-time emotion sensing (e.g., facial recognition, voice analysis) and combining them with traditional therapist observations, the system enables precise emotional analysis. Machine learning models are employed to identify patterns and recommend responses for therapists, enhancing the quality of patient interactions. Additionally, an interactive Tableau dashboard visualizes key insights, offering actionable feedback to therapists for crafting personalized treatment plans.

Key Features:

AI-powered emotion detection during therapy sessions.
Centralized database for managing patient records and emotional data.
Machine learning models to predict therapeutic responses.
Data visualization using Tableau for intuitive insights.
Impact:
The project bridges the gap between human expertise and AI's analytical capabilities, fostering evidence-based, personalized, and effective therapy sessions.
